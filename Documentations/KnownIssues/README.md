# Known Issues

Point-in-time records of issues discovered in code reviews that were not
blockers at the time of the review and therefore not fixed immediately. Each
dated file is a snapshot of a specific review pass; use them as a backlog
when picking up follow-up work.

## Conventions

- One file per review pass, named `YYYY-MM-DD-<context>-findings.md`.
- Each issue has a stable ID of the form `<slice>.<N>` so it can be referenced
  from commit messages and future reviews (`fix(M3.1): …`, `re: known-issue M6.2`).
- Severity is one of: **Blocker** (must fix before shipping), **Major** (real
  bug but ship-acceptable for now), **Minor** (polish), **False positive**
  (kept for bookkeeping so the same path isn't re-flagged next time).
- When an issue is fixed, update its row with the fix commit hash and leave
  the entry in place — don't delete — so the history is preserved.

## Files

- [2026-04-10-rc4-review-findings.md](2026-04-10-rc4-review-findings.md) —
  findings from the pre-v2.0.0-RC.4 parallel review of branch
  `feature/socket-injected-endpoint-reconnection` (9 slices, ~11.5k LOC).
  Three Blockers were fixed before this file was written; the rest of the
  Majors and Minors are tracked here.
